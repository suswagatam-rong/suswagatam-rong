Hi, I'm **Suswagatam** ðŸ‘‹. I write clean, efficient codeâ€”whether it's for web applications or system-level projects. I'm primarily a backend developer with a solid background in Java, C, and Python, and practical experience with Spring Boot. Currently, I'm expanding my skill set by learning the MERN stack. I also have a strong admiration for low-level programming, which shapes my approach to solving problems. Looking ahead, I'm planning to transition into Machine Learning ðŸ¤–.

- ðŸ›  **Expertise:** Java, C, Python, and more  
- ðŸ”§ **Current Technologies:** Spring Boot, and now learning MERN stack  
- ðŸš€ **Notable Projects:** [Work Oasis](https://github.com/suswagatam-rong/work-oasis), [Advanced Keylogger](https://github.com/suswagatam-rong/keylogger-python/tree/main), [Kai Shell](https://github.com/suswagatam-rong/kai-shell)  
- ðŸ”® **Future Plans:** Transition into Machine Learning
